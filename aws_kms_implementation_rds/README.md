**Title:** Implementing Customer Managed KMS Keys for RDS PostgreSQL in AWS

**Introduction:**
Hello everyone, today I will guide you through the process of implementing Customer Managed KMS Keys for RDS PostgreSQL instances in AWS. This approach ensures enhanced security and control over your data encryption keys. Let's dive in.

**Steps:**

**1. Log in to AWS Console:**
Begin by logging into your AWS Management Console.

**2. Navigate to RDS:**
Go to the RDS service in the AWS Management Console.

**3. Choose Databases:**
Select the "Databases" tab to view your existing database instances.

**4. Select the DB Instance:**
Choose the specific RDS instance for which you want to create a manual snapshot.

**5. Create Manual Snapshot:**
Under the instance details, navigate to "Instance actions" and select "Take snapshot" to create a manual snapshot of your database.

**6. Copy the Manual Snapshot:**
Go to the "Snapshots" section, select the manual snapshot you just created, and choose "Actions" > "Copy snapshot."

**7. Configure New Snapshot:**
Enter the desired name for the new DB Snapshot Identifier. Additionally, select the new AWS KMS key you want to use for encryption.

**8. Confirm Snapshot Creation:**
Review the configuration and confirm the creation of the new snapshot linked with the specified encryption key.

**9. Verify the New Snapshot:**
Navigate to the new manual snapshot, select "Actions" > "Restore snapshot," and verify the settings, including the DB Instance Identifier and instance name.

**10. Restore DB Instance:**
Proceed to restore the DB instance using the new settings and encryption key.

**11. Validate the New KMS Key:**
Once the new RDS instance is launched, go to the configuration section and confirm that the instance is using the desired AWS KMS key for encryption.

**Conclusion:**
By following these steps, you have successfully implemented Customer Managed KMS Keys for your RDS PostgreSQL instance. This approach provides you with greater control and security over your data encryption keys, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of your sensitive information.
